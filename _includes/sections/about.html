    Hi! I am an EECS sophomore at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the College of Engineering. <br /><br/>


    I am passionate about anything that has to do with the intersection between Mechanical and Electrical Engineering! Along the way, I've spent my middle school and high school years designing and working alongside excellent mentors and peers and some of the best and brightest in competitive robotics to create some of my proudest achievements. Today, I am an assistant researcher at the Computational Autonomy and Robotics Laboratory at the University of Michigan. I am also of many other passions, including digital photography, mountain biking, surfing, and hiking. <br /><br/>


    I'm always looking for more opportunities to put my experiences into practical use and develop more skills to become a stronger problem solver and engineer. If you have anything in mind, please feel free to reach out to me via email at yujustin@umich.edu! <br /><br/>
