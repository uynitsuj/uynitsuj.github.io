    Hi! I am an EECS sophomore at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the College of Engineering. <br /><br/>


    I am an aspiring robotics engineer from San Diego, California who is highly interested in biomimetic robotic hardware design. Along the way, I've spent my middle school and high school years designing and working alongside excellent mentors and peers and some of the best and brightest in competitive robotics to create some of my proudest achievements. Today, I am an assistant researcher at the Computational Autonomy and Robotics Laboratory at the University of Michigan, and am also involved in the MRover student design team. I am also of many other passions, including digital photography, mountain biking, and hiking. <br /><br/>


    After graduation, I plan to pursue either research or industry roles that allow me to tackle challenging problems in robotics hardware and control systems or in the development of novel biomimetic robotic actuators. I'm always looking for more opportunities to put my experiences into practical use and develop more skills to become a stronger problem solver and engineer. If you have anything in mind, please feel free to reach out to me via email at yujustin@umich.edu. <br /><br/>
