<div>

    I'm an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Michigan College of Engineering, where I've gained
    diverse
    experience as an undergraduate researcher, teaching assistant, and design team lead. I'm passionate about
    the intersection of ME, EE, and CS, particularly in robotics
    applications. Additionally, I enjoy golfing, hiking, digital photography, and mountain biking.

    I am excited to announce that I'll be joining the University of California Berkeley as an EECS Ph.D. student,
    researching and concentrating in artificial intelligence and robotics. If you have any opportunities or ideas in
    mind, please don't
    hesitate to contact me at yujustin@berkeley.edu! <br /><br />
