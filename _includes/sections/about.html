    Hi! I am a sophomore studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Michigan College of Engineering, where I am also an undergraduate research assistant, teaching assistant, and the team lead for the Michigan Mars Rover RF/Communications electrical team. I have a deep appreciation for anything to do with the union of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering - such as applications to robotic systems! I am also of many other passions, including digital photography, mountain biking, and hiking.


    I'm always looking for more opportunities to put my experiences into practical use and develop more skills to become a stronger problem solver and engineer. If you have anything in mind, please feel free to reach out to me via email at yujustin@umich.edu! <br /><br/>
