<div>

    I'll be joining the University of California Berkeley as a first-year EECS Ph.D. student,
    researching and concentrating in artificial intelligence and robotics. I received my B.S.E. in Electrical
    Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2023.
    <br><br>
    I am deeply inspired by the exploration of the final frontier by contributing to the next generation
    of space explorers. In my view, intelligent and dynamic robotic explorers are the perfect candidate.
    Outside of academics, I enjoy golfing, hiking, digital photography, and mountain biking.
