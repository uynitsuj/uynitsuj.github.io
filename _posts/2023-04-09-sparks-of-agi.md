It has become increasingly evident to me that we are living in the century when humanity is entrusted with the immense responsibility of developing artificial general intelligence systems that exceed human abilities.
<br>
This is the single most important thing our species will have done with our time on this planet.
<br>
The most impactful scientific discoveries, inventions, medical breakthroughs, and current political systems have come into the world through the birth canal of the human brain. We Homo Sapiens have thus far been the sole architects of our own future.
<br>
Less than two weeks ago, the team at Microsoft Research responsible for investigating OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 published their findings in a paper titled Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4 ([Bubeck et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf)).
<br>
The first author of the paper, Sebastien Bubeck, gave a talk of the same name at CSAIL MIT on the same evening the paper was published (22nd of March). If you have 50 minutes to spare, I highly recommend viewing the video as an abridged version of the paper.
