It has become increasingly evident to me that I am living in the century when humanity is entrusted with the immense responsibility of developing artificial general intelligence systems that exceed human abilities.

This is the single most important thing our species will have done with our time on this planet.

The most impactful scientific discoveries, inventions, medical breakthroughs, and current political systems have come into the world through the birth canal of the human brain. We Homo Sapiens have thus far been the sole architects of our own future.

<br>

A little under three weeks ago, the team at Microsoft Research responsible for investigating OpenAI’s GPT-4 for the development of Bing Chat published their findings in a paper titled _Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4_ ([Bubeck et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf)).

<br>

The first author of the paper, Sébastien Bubeck, gave a talk of the same name at CSAIL MIT on the same evening the paper was published (22nd of March). If you have 50 minutes to spare, I highly recommend viewing the recording as an abridged version of the paper's findings.

The rest of this post will be dedicated to exploring findings from the paper that I feel are worth highlighting, that are also not covered by Sébastien's talk for the sake of redundancy.
