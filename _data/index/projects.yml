- name: Legged Robot State Estimation using Invariant Kalman Filtering and Algorithmically Learned Contact Events
  descr: "<b>Affiliation/Role: Researcher and Hardware Designer for University of Michigan CURLY lab</b><br> 
  The deep learning contact estimator takes in proprioceptive measurements from a quadruped robot and estimates the instantaneous ground contact state of the robot. An additional sensor suite was designed to provide experimental groundtruth using simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and to generally augment autonomous capabilities of the MIT Minicheetah. It houses and protects a vision system along with the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier used for the experiment's contact estimator. The sensor suite platorm has been made public for all other Minicheetah groups to take advantage of."

  Weight: 119.8 lbs <br>
  Top Speed: 10.5 mph <br><br>
  Gromit has an extremely reliable and robust two stage continuous elevator, fashioning a virtual four bar linkage on the inner carriage on which both the ball intake and the hatch panel intake are integrated. <br>
  Gromit ranked 1st seed alliance at Monterey Bay Regional and advanced to become, for the first time in team history, an Alliance Captain at the FRC World Championship in Houston. <br>
  Awards: Quality Award - Sponsored by Motorola, 1st Seed @ Monterey Bay Regional. 33-13-0 W-L-T Record in Official Play."

- name: 2018 FRC Robot - Guido
  descr: "<b>Affiliation/Role: Member of Mechanical Design and Fabrication for Team 3128, the Aluminum Narwhals. </b><br>
  Dimensions: 33&#34; W x 28&#34; L x 54&#34; H <br>
  Weight: 119.7 lbs <br>
  Top Speed: 9.5 mph <br><br>
  At the start of the season, we prioritized cube scoring performance at the Exchange Zone, Switch, and Scale. Guido has an extremely reliable and robust two stage cascade elevator on which both the cube intake and the climbing mechanism were integrated. <br>
  Guido proved a formidable machine becoming the Finalist Alliance Captain at the San Diego Regional, thereby securing a spot at the FRC World Championship in Houston. <br>
  In Houston, we proceeded to play in Finals matches with the first seed alliance in the Newton Division, marking the furthest advancement as a result of robot performance in team history."
