- name: Mini Cheetah Autonomous Sensor Suite Platform
  descr: "Affiliation/Role: Hardware Systems Designer for University of Michigan CURLY group<br> This sensor suite was designed to augment the autonomous capabilities of the MIT Minicheetah. It houses and protects an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier as well as a vision system. The suite will accept either the Intel depth camera or L515 LiDAR system. Additional components such as network switches may be mounted at the rear. 2 cargo straps are run through the sensor suite frame to secure a Krisdonia portable battery to the underside of the Minicheetah. Sensor suite platorm has been made public for all other Minicheetah groups to take advantage of. (Github link with stl files below)"

- name: 3D-Printed 6DoF Robotic Arm
  descr: "Affiliation/Role: Systems Designer<br>Personal project over the 2020 coronavirus quarantine summer to build a 6DoF robot arm platform from complete scratch. This started off as a pretty ambitious project to build a pretty accurate/precise and repeatable 6DoF arm. But then because of various constraints I scaled it down to become mostly a learning experience in working out forward kinematics and inverse kinematics, and also in running complex visualization pipelines in python. Robot Control Interface is built from scratch in python using TKinter module with imbedded matplotlib mplot3d so that I could teach myself forward and inverse kinematics on a 6DoF robot arm. Robot uses NEMA 17 stepper motors for every joint besides the 2nd, where a NEMA 23 and a larger controller is necessary for greater torque. Robot control is completely open-loop. Serial data is sent over USB in order to prepare motor movement and execution commands using my custom control protocol. The basis for my custom Arduino sketch comes from iforce2d's Coordinated Stepper Movement Arduino Sketch. And my Over-Serial command protocol integrated into my Custom Arduino sketch comes from educ8s.tv. <br>Tools: Solidworks, Python, Arduino IDE <br>My journey can be read in the homepage link below"

- name: Elevated Robotic Assistive Device
  descr: "Affiliation/Role: Lead Mechanical Systems Designer<br>Since the advent of robotic systems and devices, the primary application focus has been with enhancing
          productivity and safety in industrial and agricultural markets such as manufacturing assembly lines, warehouse package/container retrieval
          and disbursement, and crop harvesting to name a few. Robotic assistance devices have also been
          deployed in military applications employing various form factors (e.g. tanks, unmanned aerial vehicles)
          with various levels of artificial intelligence. The popularity of robotic assistance devices in personal and
          domestic markets comparably have been primarily confined to toys including flying devices (e.g. drones)
          and cleaning devices (e.g. carpet or pool cleaners). Consequently, these devices typically occupy space in
          the open air or on the ground. While floor-based mobile robots may have great
          potential for automating processes and assisting people (i.e. the disabled and infirmed or home/industrial
          security), their need to navigate around objects makes them an expensive option
          while still not alleviating the potential for a sense of obtrusiveness on the part of the users. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide an elevated robotic system which
          provides smooth and efficient traversal along an elevated track. <br>

- name: 2020 FRC Robot - Cheems the Harvester of Souls
  descr: "Affiliation/Role: Head of Mechanical Design and Fabrication for Team 3128, the Aluminum Narwhals. <br>
  Dimensions: 25&#34; W x 28&#34; L x 44.7&#34; H <br>
  Weight: 110 lbs <br>
  Top Speed: 10.9 mph <br><br>
  Cheems is a transforming arm bot comprising a high-speed four Falcon 500 brushless motor drivetrain with a shooter at the end of the large arm driven by two Falcon 500s. This year we decided to make a bot that could drive under the control panel and also shoot over tall bots. Cheems had a hopper and Power Cell manipulator that would work at any arm angle. Cheems also fashioned a passively deployed polycarbonate intake with two bumper-wide rollers, which passed balls to Cheems' indexer, allowing for the Power Cells to be organized into a single-file line and traverse to the shooter. Finally, our climb mechanism. Our climb was able to deploy in a split second due to the constant force springs on the climber so that when the arm went past a certain angle the climber ends would hit a hard stop and rapidly deploy. Then it would winch itself up using two BAG motors. <br>
  Though Cheems only had the opportunity to perform at Del Mar Regional, we are very proud of the work we put in and have learned greatly from this season. <br>

  Gromit has an extremely reliable and robust two stage continuous elevator, fashioning a virtual four bar linkage as the inner carriage on which both the cargo intake and the hatch panel intake are integrated. The polycarbonate cargo intake consists of wide top and bottom rollers allowing Gromit to secure cargo upon contact. The polycarbonate hatch intake consists of a pin-and-slot swiveling finger with a pusher tab allowing for hatch pickup and dropoff at unforgiving angles and horizontal displacements. The reverse gearboxes situated in the rear feature integrated “heely” wheels that come into contact with the ground when the robot tips backwards, allowing for control during the climbing sequence which utilizes two large pistons in the front and a rack and pinion system in the back. Gromit ranked 1st seed alliance at Monterey Bay Regional and advanced to become, for the first time in team history, an Alliance Captain at the FRC World Championship in Houston. <br>

  Coming right out of kickoff, we decided to prioritize power cube scoring performance at the Exchange Zone, Switch, and Scale. Guido has an extremely reliable and robust two stage cascade elevator on which both the power cube intake and the climbing mechanism were integrated. Guido also fashioned an active-captive roller power cube intake utilizing both dynamic and static Colson wheels to capture and secure cubes. The elevators featured pistons that could extend shoulder bolts to catch onto a plate and lock the entire elevator once we had reached a full climb. This allowed us to deploy our &#34;buddy bar&#34; at the rear of the bot on which other robots could hang from. Guido proved a formidable machine, advancing our team to become the Finalist Alliance Captain at the San Diego Regional, securing a spot at the FRC World Championship in Houston. In Houston, we proceeded to play in Finals matches with the first seed alliance in the Newton Division, marking the furthest our team has advanced as a result of robot performance. <br>

  With our 2017 robot, we wanted to build a robot that excelled at the key elements of the game. Throughout numerous revisions and designs, we settled on Ferb. Ferb had a reliable scaling mechansim that efficently and effectively hooked on to the rope and scaled in just under 5 seconds. Ferb also sported an active gear mechanism that allowed for gear intake from both the loading zone and the ground, allowing us to ensure that all gears that ended up by the airship made it on. Ferb was sturdy and reliable and ended up allowing our team to become the Finalist Alliance Captain at the San Diego Regional, securing our spot at the FRC World Championship in Houston. <br>
