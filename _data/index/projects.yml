- name: Faster PI0-FAST model inference time with DCT Early Stopping
  descr: "Objective: Faster PI0-FAST robot VLA (Vision-Language-Action) model inference time; A DCT early stopping trick implementation for FAST (Frequency-Space Action Sequence Tokenization). The idea is to decode only the first few DCT coefficients from the PaLi-Gemma VLM rather than waiting for a full action chunk inference to complete. This can cut down inference to action time by roughly half since around the first 3-4 frequency harmonics of the DCT are typically enough for a coarse action sequence reconstruction."
